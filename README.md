Final project for Engineering Web-Based Systems.
This project is a survey system which allows users to create surveys, respond to others' surveys, and view others' responses to their own surveys.
I used phpMyAdmin to host the mySQL database.
The system is based on an MVC structure using php, HTML, and JavaScript.
