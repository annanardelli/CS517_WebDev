<h2>Survey Builder</h2>
<p>Final project for Engineering Web-Based Systems.</p>
<p>This project is a survey system which allows users to create surveys, respond to others' surveys, and view others' responses to their own surveys.
I used phpMyAdmin to host the mySQL database.</p>
<p>The system is based on an MVC structure using php, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>This image shows a sample of the responses page. The responses to the survey are simply listed after the question.</p>
<p>Over winter break I plan on finetuning this page to be able to show what account gave the response and to be able to view only the responses from one account on a page.</p>
